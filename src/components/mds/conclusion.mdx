# Conclusion

In this paper, we presented SWIFT, a distributed one-stage planner designed for efficient multi-quadrotor trajectory optimization in complex, cluttered environments. By unifying depth perception, interaction-aware planning, and motion prediction into a single feedforward architecture, SWIFT achieves real-time trajectory generation without reliance on global maps or centralized control. Our method introduces a confidence-guided cross-attention mechanism to selectively model dynamic inter-agent interactions and incorporates a physically grounded guidance learning framework that promotes smooth, safe, and goal-directed motion.
Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that SWIFT consistently outperforms existing modular and learning-based baselines in terms of trajectory quality, collision avoidance, flight efficiency, and scalability. In dense multi-agent environments, SWIFT maintains high success rates under aggressive speeds and increasing agent densities, highlighting its robustness and adaptability. Furthermore, we propose a collaborative odometry drift correction strategy based on asynchronous optimization and inter-agent visual detections, improving positioning accuracy and operational safety during decentralized flight.
