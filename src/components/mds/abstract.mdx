# Abstract

This paper presents SWIFT (Swarm-Wise Inference for Fast Trajectory Planning), a distributed one-stage planner designed for efficient multi-quadrotor trajectory optimization in cluttered environments. SWIFT unifies depth-based perception, interaction-aware modeling, and trajectory prediction into a single lightweight network, enabling decentralized real-time planning without reliance on global maps. Each quadrotor processes its local depth observation and asynchronously received neighbor intentions to predict multiple candidate trajectories, leveraging a confidence-guided cross-attention mechanism to selectively model critical inter-agent interactions. The proposed framework achieves sub-millisecond planning latency while ensuring collision avoidance, dynamic feasibility, and cooperative behavior under limited communication. Furthermore, a visual-inertial odometry drift correction strategy based on inter-agent visual detections enhances positioning accuracy during real-world flights. Extensive simulations and forest experiments validate that SWIFT outperforms existing baselines in trajectory smoothness, success rate, scalability, and robustness across diverse scenarios.
